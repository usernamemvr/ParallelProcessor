# Parallel CSV Processor

A high-performance web application that processes and analyzes large CSV files using a **client-server architecture**. Leveraging **Java multithreading**, the application splits CSV files into chunks and processes them concurrently, significantly reducing processing time for large datasets.

## Features

- Upload CSV files directly from the frontend.
- Concurrent processing of CSV files using Java multithreading.
- Display product statistics dynamically based on category and quantity sold.
- Responsive frontend built with ReactJS.
- Backend API implemented with Spring Boot.
- Persistent storage using PostgreSQL.
- Supports large files (1KB â€“ 500MB) with optimized processing time.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Spring Boot, Java (Multithreading)
- Frontend: ReactJS
- Database: PostgreSQL
- API Communication: REST

## Future Improvements

- Implement checkboxes to toggle between **max and min sold products**.
- Add separate pages for **max and min product lists**.
- Add a **home icon/button** for easier navigation.
- Enable **file download** for processed results.
